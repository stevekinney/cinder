/**
 * The server-owned route family: its label, its list, and its endpoints.
 *
 * Every test works against a conversation it creates under a unique title,
 * and asserts on THAT conversation rather than on list totals. The variant's
 * store is in-memory and per-process, and Playwright runs the whole file
 * against one `preview` server, so conversations outlive the test that made
 * them. A `toHaveCount` on the list would pass alone and fail in a suite —
 * order-dependence dressed up as a flake.
 *
 * Two tests here drive real browser paths: the create flow's `fetch` plus
 * reload, and the incremental-rendering test, which streams a `ReadableStream`
 * through the page's session controller. An earlier version of this comment
 * claimed only the create flow used browser fetch, which was wrong about the
 * file it sits in.
 *
 * The `request`-fixture tests stay out of the cross-engine shards: that
 * fixture is a Node-side HTTP client, so running it under three engines
 * executes identical code three times.
