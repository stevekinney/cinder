# GridListItem

Keyboard-navigable cell within a grid-list layout for selectable item grids.

## Usage

`GridListItem` is a compose-only leaf of [`GridList`](../grid-list/README.md).
The idiomatic API is `GridList.Item`, reached through the parent
namespace — see the [grid-list README](../grid-list/README.md#usage) for the composed
snippet. The flat `@lostgradient/cinder/grid-list-item` subpath remains exported for
à-la-carte builds that import the leaf directly.
