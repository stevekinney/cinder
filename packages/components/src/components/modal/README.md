# Modal

Generic modal shell for rich content, forms, and structured workflows. Use the more specialised components when the content fits their narrower contract.

## When to use

- Presenting rich or structured content (forms, multi-step wizards, detail views) inside a blocking overlay.
- Collecting structured input — especially when multiple fields or widgets are involved.
- Displaying content that requires user interaction before the page can continue, but where the interaction is more than a simple yes/no.

## When not to use

- Two-action confirm/cancel prompts — use [`ConfirmDialog`](../confirm-dialog/README.md) instead. It handles autofocus on the cancel button, `aria-describedby`, and the destructive-variant button automatically.
- Urgent blocking acknowledgements that must not be dismissed by Escape or backdrop click — use [`AlertDialog`](../alert-dialog/README.md) instead.
- Navigation — use a page transition or router link instead. Modals break the browser's back-button mental model.
- Persistent side content — use a [`Drawer`](../drawer/README.md) or [`Sidebar`](../sidebar/README.md) so the content stays visible while the user works.
- Displaying information that does not require a decision — use a [`Popover`](../popover/README.md) or inline content instead.

## Dialog model

Cinder provides three dialog-level components with distinct interaction contracts.

**`Modal`** is the generic shell. It handles focus capture/restore, body scroll lock, Escape dismissal, backdrop dismissal, and an optional close button. All three dismissal affordances are on by default (`dismissOnBackdropClick`, `dismissOnEscape`, `showCloseButton`). Use Modal when the content is richer than a simple prompt.

**`ConfirmDialog`** is a preset for user-initiated binary decisions. It composes Modal + two Buttons, defaults focus to the cancel button (the industry-standard guard against accidental destructive confirms), and wires `aria-describedby` automatically. Escape, backdrop click, and the close-X all fire `oncancel`. Use it for "Delete account?", "Discard changes?", and similar two-action prompts.

**`AlertDialog`** is a preset for urgent, blocking acknowledgements. It renders Modal with `role="alertdialog"`, `dismissOnBackdropClick={false}`, `dismissOnEscape={false}`, and no close button. The user must click an explicit action button to proceed. Use it for session expiry and system-level errors — cases where the _system_ surfaces a condition that must be acknowledged before continuing. For user-initiated actions (even high-impact ones), use `ConfirmDialog` instead.

## The `role` prop and `alertdialog`

Modal accepts `role="alertdialog"` directly. This is intentional: some applications need to compose their own sticky dialog outside the `AlertDialog` preset (for example, a dialog with richer body content than `AlertDialog`'s plain-text `description` prop allows).

When composing `role="alertdialog"` on Modal directly:

- Set `dismissOnBackdropClick={false}` and `dismissOnEscape={false}` — otherwise the urgent-blocking contract is broken.
- Set `showCloseButton={false}` — a close-X contradicts the "must acknowledge" intent.
- Pass `describedById` pointing at a descriptive element in the body — `aria-describedby` is required for `alertdialog`.

If the content fits the plain-text `description` constraint, prefer `AlertDialog` over composing Modal + `role="alertdialog"` manually.

## Related components

- [`ConfirmDialog`](../confirm-dialog/README.md) — pre-wired confirm/cancel variant built on Modal. Use for binary decisions.
- [`AlertDialog`](../alert-dialog/README.md) — sticky alert dialog that cannot be dismissed by Escape or backdrop click. Use for urgent acknowledgements.
- [`Drawer`](../drawer/README.md) — side-anchored overlay for supplementary content.
- [`Sheet`](../sheet/README.md) — bottom-anchored overlay for mobile-style interactions.
- [`Popover`](../popover/README.md) — non-blocking floating panel for contextual content.

## Usage

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import Modal from '@lostgradient/cinder/modal';
</script>

<Modal />
```
