# Collapsible

Single-panel show/hide disclosure — the single-item counterpart to Accordion. A labeled trigger toggles one region, animating its height open and closed with Svelte's native `slide` transition.

## Usage

Uncontrolled — the component owns its state:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import Collapsible from 'cinder/collapsible';
</script>

<Collapsible trigger="Shipping details">
  <p>Orders ship within two business days.</p>
</Collapsible>
```

Controlled — the parent owns the state with `bind:open`:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import Collapsible from 'cinder/collapsible';

  let open = $state(false);
</script>

<Collapsible bind:open trigger="Controlled panel">
  <p>Open state is shared with the parent.</p>
</Collapsible>
```

### State model

Without `bind:open`, `open` is the initial local value and the component manages subsequent toggles; pass `open={true}` to render initially open. With `bind:open`, the parent owns the state. `onToggle` fires on every toggle with the next boolean, so one-way observers stay in sync.

The `trigger` prop is either a string or a snippet receiving `{ open, disabled }`, letting the label react to state (for example, swapping "Show" and "Hide").

## Accessibility

- The trigger is a native `<button type="button">`, so Enter and Space activation and tab order come from the browser. `disabled` uses the real attribute, removing it from the tab order.
- The trigger carries `aria-expanded`; the panel is a `role="region"` labeled by the trigger via `aria-labelledby`.
- The panel is removed from the DOM when closed (standard disclosure behavior). `aria-controls` is emitted only while the panel exists, so it never references a missing element. Each open panel registers as a named `region` landmark — on a page with many open Collapsibles, weigh that against landmark-navigation noise.
- Height animation collapses to zero duration under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, and the chevron rotation transition is disabled in CSS.

For multiple coordinated sections where opening one may close others, use [`Accordion`](../accordion/README.md) instead. See [`collapsible.a11y.md`](./collapsible.a11y.md) for a detailed comparison of when to use each pattern.

| Prop       | Type      | Required | Default | Description                                                                         |
| ---------- | --------- | -------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `class`    | `string`  | no       | —       | Additional classes merged onto the root element.                                    |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | no       | `false` | When true, the trigger cannot be toggled.                                           |
| `idBase`   | `string`  | no       | —       | Base used to derive the trigger and panel ARIA ids. Auto-generated when omitted.    |
| `open`     | `boolean` | no       | `false` | Bindable open state. Without binding, the initial value the component then manages. |
| `trigger`  | `string`  | yes      | —       | Trigger label text. (The snippet form is template-only; see the type above.)        |
